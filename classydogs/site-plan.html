      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        Kyle and Alexis Johnson are from Idaho Falls, Idaho. They met in high school and were close friends throughout those years. They didn’t start dating until college and became married April of 2022. Kyle graduated from Brigham Young University - Idaho with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and works as a computer scientist while assisting in running the Classy Dogs with his wife. Alexis also graduated from Brigham Young University – Idaho with a bachelor’s degree in Professional Studies. She is a stay-at-home mom and the co-founder of Classy Dogs. They currently live in Rexburg, Idaho with their first child. 
        Kyle and Alexis both have a deep love for food, and a special appreciation for hot dogs. They originally dreamed of running their own company, something similar to a food truck type of business. Once they both graduated from college, they set their sights on creating their own hot dog company, which has grown from a mobile food truck, to a now established Classy Dogs building in their hometown of Idaho Falls. 
        “We wanted to eventually have a business of our own that we both would love to operate and work together in creating something that we love. Classy Dogs has become exactly that, and more. We love to come up with new improvements to this business and brainstorm ways we can make it become even bigger than it is. It is such a rewarding feeling to have people enjoy something you created and put so much effort into. Thank you to the Classy Dogs’ community and to everyone who has helped us achieve our dreams.” – Kyle and Alexis Johnson
